- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @loopmine
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in working with all individuals and new teams. We are building a community focused social engineering platform, capable of competing across sectors.
      Think of what we are building as a hybrid blockchain telecomms marketplace.
      If you can imagine a box full of knowledge, an ajacent box wants some of that knowledge, we are able to trade that knowledge with other vendor builders on platform and
      on blockchain and offer in to existing telecoms suppliers with our carrier class platform. Read on. 
      
      Our community guided platform is based on its structure and capabilities. We believe a guided structure will offer far more appropriate opportunity and structure than bad       choices of some failed actors typical of typical structured
      community platforms. This project has a sole ambition of providing its users with a competative advantage.
      Our teams and clients can utilise this competative advantage to build on new ideas create tradable revenue and build businesses of any description.
      Putting advanced knowledge components in the hands of users at a fraction of the cost from competing vendors is exstremley important to us.
      Our community can build and learn how to expand as it grows with tradable business goals.
      
      This is an ambitious project, our framework is built on cutting edge concepts capable of carrier class performance, in simple terms we can provide and sell our community       services 
      into established telecoms providers on a carrier class network.
      The latter of which will be designed to provide our users with fresh market outlets. Also we will provide our platform builders with reasonable scope to trade in new           revenue 
      generating ideas as they build, to make a profit.
      This platform is built on tradable ideas, we call these platform knowledge components. The commercial aspects are a win win both for our community and telecoms providers       who are 
      desperetaley in need of new revenue generating ideas. Typically to fill in and take up the slack from years of free give aways of core products such as talktime and free       messages and date.
       
      Empowring the bold across our network is about employing cutting edge concepts used in cloud and other types of over the top communications. 
      Our ability to connect will rest on newly built infrastructure components such as Network functions virtualisation, NFV. Virtual network functions
      VNFs and other virtual appliances.
      
      Cost will be reduced across all our platforms hardware and software, employing COTS white box switches and servers in all our data centres, bare metal, trellis, ONOS,open       source hardware and open compute components are 
      accepted and will form the bases of the platform standard.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently analysing the best way forward, and setting up team space we can focus and collaborate on differnt asspects required to make this pilot project happen.
- üíûÔ∏è I would like to collaborate on blockchain governance layers, this will form part of our governeance and interchange network. We would also like to talk with knowlegable        partners and individuals who work with network functions virtualisation where we will offer out the services to tellecoms, 
     and form the bases for our owned infrastructure. Virtual network functions vendors VNF, and industry 4.0 connectors with agility to connect and offer software and
     hardware based services.
     Global discovery protocols, cloud infrastructure, secure front end applictions, a visual DAG dapp that is visual could be suitable and considered.
- üì´ How to reeach me, you can reach me by email in the first instance by sending me a message to @loopmine, or networkfunctions@gmail.com
