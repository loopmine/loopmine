- üëã  Hi, I‚Äôm @loopmine
- üëÄ  I‚Äôm interested in working with knowlegable individuals and new teams. We are currentley building out a community focused physical engineering platform based on todays         social norms as social business platform able to connect and ahare knowledge based components across competing  sectors.
      Think of what we are building as a hybrid blockchain telecomms marketplace cloud infrastrictire as its core and industry 4.0 as the target market.
      If you can imagine how it works we have a platform with many box type knowledge components arranged in a DAG format containing knowledge bounty put together by        
      individuals om platfor. These can then be exchanged and shared with an ajacent box who commits to buy this knowledge based component bounty in need of wants some of that       knowledge. The trade is achied via blockchain and a governance layer suited to trade in knowledge based assets who choose to trade with other vendor builders on platform.       Read on. 
      
      Our community guided platform is based on its governence structure and capabilities. We believe a guided structure offers more appropriate reward and opportunity and           providing structure as apposed to unstructured community based platforms. This project has a sole ambition of providing its users with a continuous competative advantage.
      Our teams and clients can utilise this competative advantage to build on new ideas create tradable revenue and build businesses of any description.
      this advantage is designed to make knowledge based components easily accesable tradable and usefull compnents to users at a fraction of the cost from competing vendors 
      we believe is an exstremley important asset and provides our community acccess to build tradable business assets.
      
      This is an ambitious project, our framework is built on cutting edge concepts capable of carrier class performance, in simple terms we can provide and sell our community       services into target markets such as established telecoms providers industry 4.0 on a carrier class network.
      The latter of which will be designed to our users with fresh market outlets. Also we will provide our platform builders and community with a reasonable scope           to       trade in new knowledge assets generating revenue from ideas and oportunity as they emerge as an ongoing form of income.
      This platform is built on tradable ideas, we call these platform assets knowledge components. The commercial aspects are a win win both for our community and telecoms           providers whom we work with in need of new revenue generating ideas capable of taking up the slack from years of free give aways of core products such as                       talktime and free messages and date.
       
      Empowring the bold across our network is about employing cutting edge concepts used in cloud and other types of over the top communications. 
      Our ability to connect will rest on newly built infrastructure, new appliance components such as Network functions virtualisation, NFV. Virtual network functions
      VNFs and other virtual appliances.
      
      Cost will be reduced across all our platforms hardware and software, employing COTS white box switches and servers in all our data centres, bare metal, trellis, ONOS,open       source hardware and open compute components are 
      accepted and will form the bases of the platform standard.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently analysing the best way forward, and setting up team space we can focus and collaborate on differnt asspects required to make this pilot project happen.
- üíûÔ∏è I would like to collaborate on blockchain governance layers, this will form part of our governeance and interchange network. We would also like to talk with knowlegable        partners and individuals who work with network functions virtualisation where we will offer out the services to tellecoms, 
     and form the bases for our owned infrastructure. Virtual network functions vendors VNF, and industry 4.0 connectors with agility to connect and offer software and
     hardware based services.
     Global discovery protocols, cloud infrastructure, secure front end applictions, a visual DAG dapp that is visual could be suitable and considered.
